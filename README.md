# Real Interview

Flask application that guides a candidate from account setup through resume upload, job application, and an AI-driven mock interview. The web UI is served from the same server as the backend.

# note:
🔒 The source code is maintained in a private repository.
📂 This repo contains only documentation and project overview.

## 🎯 Vision
Build an Agentic AI application that simulates mock interviews based on a candidate’s resume and job description.  
Initial form: **chat-based app** → later extended with analytics, personalization, and enterprise features.

## Modules

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP (3–4 months)
**Objective:** Deliver a secure, working chat-based mock interview app.

### Features
- Resume upload (PDF/DOC).
- Job description input parsing.
- Chat interview simulation.
- Feedback summary (strengths, weaknesses, improvements).


**Do not commit `.env`** — it contains secrets. Use `.env_copy` or similar as a template without real keys.

---

## Launch the application

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB running and reachable via `MONGODB_URI`
- Valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`

### Install dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the server

From the project root with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
python -m app.real_interview.backend.server
```

### Open the UI

In your browser:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Use port **5000** unless you set `PORT` to something else in `.env`.

### Typical flow in the UI

1. **Sign up** or **Log in**
2. **Upload resume** (PDF) or **Fetch resume** to select an existing one
3. **Continue to job application** — job link or pasted description, then save
4. **Start interview** — HR summary and panel load; chat with interviewers (`[I1]`, `[I2]`, …)
5. **Pause interview** — conversation is summarized and saved; resume later with that context
6. **Resume interview** — continue the same session
7. **Next interviewer** / **End interview** when appropriate; feedback appears after completion
8. **Sign out** clears the browser session

## Sample interview

The example below is **illustrative** — actual questions and tone depend on your resume, job description, and which interviewer types the router assigns (`positive`, `negative`, `objective`). In the chat UI, interviewers appear as **`[I1]`**, **`[I2]`**, etc.

### Setup (before chat)

| Step | What you provide | What the app does |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Resume | PDF for a backend engineer with Python and API experience | Parses skills, roles, and projects |
| Job | Description for *Senior Backend Engineer* (Python, REST, MongoDB) | Extracts role and requirements |
| Start | Click **Start interview** | HR agent writes a first impression; router picks panel size (1 or 2) and interviewer styles |

**HR first impression (shown under “HR summary & panel”) — excerpt:**

> Alex Chen aligns well with the Senior Backend Engineer role: five years of Python services, REST APIs, and MongoDB in production. Resume shows ownership of a payments microservice and on-call rotation. Gaps vs. the posting: limited mention of Kubernetes and no explicit load-testing experience. Recommended focus for the panel: system design, failure handling, and data modeling.

**Panel plan (example for a mid/senior candidate):**

```json
{
  "experience_level": "senior",
  "panel_size": 2,
  "selected_interviewers": ["positive", "objective"],
  "routing_rationale": "Senior profile warrants two interviewers: supportive technical depth plus process-oriented follow-up."
}
```

### Chat transcript (excerpt)

```
[I1]: Hi Alex, I'm on the engineering panel. I've reviewed your background on the payments service —
     great work. Let's start simple: how would you design a REST endpoint to create a payment idempotently?

You: I'd use a client-supplied idempotency key in a header, store keys in Redis or Mongo with TTL,
     and return the same response if the key repeats within 24 hours.

[I1]: Good. What happens if Mongo is down during the idempotency check?

You: Fail fast with 503, don't double-charge; retry from the client with the same key.

[I1]: Makes sense. Can you walk through how you'd index the idempotency collection?

You: Unique index on (user_id, idempotency_key), maybe shard by user_id at scale.

[I2]: Switching to process — describe how you handled a production incident on that service.

You: We had elevated 5xx after a deploy; rolled back, traced to a connection pool misconfiguration,
     added alerts on pool saturation and a runbook step for pool sizing.

[I2]: Who was in the loop, and what did you change in the release process afterward?

You: On-call, PM for customer comms, postmortem within 48h; added staging load test and canary deploy.
```

### Pause and resume

After a few more exchanges, the candidate clicks **Pause interview**. The summarizer runs on the conversation so far and appends to `interview_summary`, for example:

> **Saved summary (excerpt):** Candidate explained idempotent payments with header keys and unique indexes; discussed 503 behavior when dependencies fail. Second interviewer covered a production rollback, stakeholder communication, and post-incident process improvements (canary, load test).

Status becomes **paused**; chat input is disabled until **Resume interview**. On resume, that summary is injected as context for the next interviewer turns so the panel does not “forget” earlier answers.

### End interview — sample feedback

After **End interview**, the feedback agent may produce structured output like:

```json
{
  "overall_assessment": "Strong technical communication and relevant backend experience; process answers were concrete.",
  "strengths": [
    "Clear idempotency and indexing explanation",
    "Honest failure-mode thinking (503, no double-charge)",
    "Structured incident narrative with follow-up process changes"
  ],
  "areas_to_improve": [
    "Expand on Kubernetes and observability if targeting this exact posting",
    "Quantify impact of the incident (duration, customers affected)"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Continue practicing system design under time pressure and deepen cloud-native tooling stories.",
  "interview_decision": "hold",
  "detailed_feedback": "You demonstrated solid API design instincts and mature incident handling. To move from hold to selected for a senior backend role, add more depth on scaling, SLOs, and platform operations aligned with the job description."
}
```

This feedback appears in the UI under **Post-interview feedback**; the full message history and summaries remain in MongoDB for that session.
